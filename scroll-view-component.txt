Although a View component is similar to a div tag, it does not scroll automatically. React Native provides the ScrollView specifically for this purpose.

ScrollComponent wraps the platform-specific scrolling functionality.

ScrollViews require a bounded height to function properly (this essentially means that the ScrollView component should be nested within a View).
