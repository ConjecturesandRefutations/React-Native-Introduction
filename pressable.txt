Of course you can use buttons to trigger actions. But there are times when we need to trigger actions on the press of other elements, such as text and images.

React Native provides a component called 'pressable' to do this.

Pressable is wrapper component that detects various stages of press interactions on its defined children.

Essentially it is a way to create a custom button

In addition to onPress, the pressable component supports several other events it can listen to:

onPressIn is called when a press is activated. 

onLongPress is triggered when a press is held for longer than 500 milliseconds.

onPressOut is called when the press gesture is deactivated.
