The stylesheet API is the recommended approach, as it promotes writing organised, easy to read and maintainable code.

By moving styles away from the render function, you make the code easier to read and understand.

Naming the styles also gives meaning to the low-level components in the render function.

Organising code in this manner also makes the code reusable and easier to maintain. It saves having to update each inline style when a global change needs to be made.

You can also create a separate global styles file and export the styles object. You can then use it in any file throughout your code base.

If you create a style object without using the stylesheet API, you won't have access to autocomplete suggestions.
