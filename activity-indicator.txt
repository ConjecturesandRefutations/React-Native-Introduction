The activity indicator component displays a circular loading indicator.

It is used to inform the user about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or saving updates.

There are 3 important props for this component:

1. size: set to small by default. Can be changed to large.
2. color: by default it uses the sytem accent colour for Android and a shade of gray for iOS. We can customise it as desired.
3. animating: controls the visibility of the component. By default it is set to 'true'. It can be set to 'false'.
