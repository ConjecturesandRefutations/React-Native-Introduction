The StatusBar component allows you to control the application's status bar.

The status bar is typically located at the top of the screen. It displays the current time, Wi-Fi and network information, battery level and other status icons.

You can change the background colour of the status bar using backgroundColor. This prop is specific to Android.

We can adjust the text colour on both platforms. 

The prop to adjust the text colour is called barStyle. Its default value is the string 'default'. This corresponds to dark text on iOS and light text on android. 

barStyle can be changed to 'dark-content' and 'light-content' to change to black or white text respectively.

You can use the 'hidden' prop to hide the status bar.
