*What is React Native*

React Native is an open-source framework for building native Android and iOS applications using React.

It uses JavaScript to access platform-specific APIs (such as camera and push notifications).

It uses React components to define the appearance and behaviour of your user interface.

React itself is a library designed for building user interfaces.

Whilst react-dom is used for websites, react-native is used for mobile apps.


*Why React Native?*

Traditionally building iOS apps requires Swift or Objective-C, and building an Android apps requires Java or Kotlin.

This meant that you would typically need to develop two separate apps - one for iOS and one for Android to cater to everyone.

With React Native, you can create one single app which works seamlessly with both platforms.

This also puts React Native in high demand in the job market; rather than assembling different teams of iOS and Android developers, businesses can opt for a single team proficient in React Native, saving time and costs. Furthermore, if the team is well-versed in React, their expertise can extend to web app development as well.
