A modal is screen that overlays the app content to provide important information or prompt the user for a decision.

By default, a modal is always visible. You need to control its visibility based on interaction. To achieve this, we require a state variable (e.g. useState hook imported from React).

onRequestClose is there to provide an alternative way to handle closing behavior when an external trigger, like the back button or a hardware control, is used (as opposed to a button or pressable within the application).

The animation type is set to 'none' by default. The prop accepts two other values.

If we set it to 'slide', the modal will slide in from (and out from) the bottom.

If you set the value to 'fade', the modal will fade into (and out of) view.

There is a prop called 'presentationStyle' which is set to fullscreen by default. 

You can change this to either 'formSheet' or 'pageSheet' to alter the appearance.

formSheet is narrow, whilst pageSheet is wider. 

*presentationStyle* only affects iOS (i.e. not Android).
