At the core of layout design with React Native is flexbox.

Flexbox is a powerful one-dimensional layout model used to arrange elements within a container.

With flexbox, you have the freedom to arrange items either horizontally or vertically.

You can easily the spacing and aligment of items within the container.

Flexbox consists of two main entities:

1. The flex container
2. The flex items

The parent container (usually a View component) is referred to as the flex container.

The immediate child components are the flex itesms.

<View>
    <View>Item 1</View>
    <View>Item 2</View>
    <View>Item 3</View>
</View>

In the sample UI above, the parent view acts as the flex container, and all the children views are flex items.

When working with flexbox, we encouter two axes:

1. Main axis
2. Cross axis

By default in CSS, the main axis runs from left to right, and the cross-axis is perpendicular to it.

However, in React Native, it is the opposite: the main axis runs from top to bottom and the cross-axis runs from left to right.
