Unlike in HTML, there is limited inheritance of styles.

When working with styles in React Native, there is no inheritance of styles from a View component to a text component.

To set a color to the text component, you need to apply the color to the text component directly.

RN still supports inheritance within nested text components. 

Inheritance from View to Text does not work, but inheritance from Text to Text does.
