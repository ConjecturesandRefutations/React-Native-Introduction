The view component is a fundamental core component in React Native that serves as a building block for creating user interfaces.

It functions as a container that supports layouts using flexbox, styling, touch handling and accessibility controls.

In web development terms, the View component can be compared to the '<div>' tag.

The View component is typically nested inside other views and can have zero or more children of any type.

By default, the View component only occupies the space taken up by its children.

Therefore the following app.js file will not render anything on the screen because there are no children within the view component:

`import { View } from 'react-native';

export default function App(){
  return <View style={{ backgroundColor: "plum" }}></View>;
}`  

However, if I update the view component to have the additional style 'flex:1' `<View style={{ flex:1, backgroundColor: "plum" }}></View>;`, the view will flexibly expand and take up all the available space on the screen

The View component can nest other views within it.

The View component is an essential core component in React Native serving as a building block for creating user interfaces. It acts as a container that supports layout and styling.

Although a View component is similar to a div tag, it does not scroll automatically. React Native provides the ScrollView specifically for this purpose.
