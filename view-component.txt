The view component is a fundamental core component in React Native that serves as a building block for creating user interfaces.

It functions as a container that supports layouts using flexbox, styling, touch handling and accessibility controls.

In web development terms, the View component can be compared to the '<div>' tag.

The View component is typically nested inside other views and can have zero or more children of any type.
